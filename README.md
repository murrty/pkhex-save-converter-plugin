# pkhex-save-converter-plugin
pkhex plugin to convert ds saves between raw and desmume saves

# usage
drag SaveConverter.dll to pkhex.exe../plugins and run pkhex.

click the option in the tools menu, and convert. if the save file is in pkhex already, it'll still be loaded as the original file name so be sure to overwrite the proper save.

# building
create a class library project with pkhex.core as a reference, and it's pretty basic from there.
